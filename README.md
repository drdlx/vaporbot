# VaporBot
It's just a simple Telegram bot I've started to have some practice as well as some fun. 

Right now it just echoes the message you write to him.

#Note
Please, keep in mind that for now on, if you want to use it, you need to launch file '...-with-dependencies.jar',
coz I haven't figured how should I compile it into the usual .jar file. It works for now on, though.
